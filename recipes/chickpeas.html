    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Enter: roasted chickpeas. They still have all the protein and heartiness of regular chickpeas, but they’ve become an irresistible salty, crunchy ingredient. Even better, they’re a great healthy vegan snack on their own!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Paprika, curry powder, or other spices (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread the chickpeas on a kitchen towel and pat them dry. Remove any loose skins.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dried chickpeas to the baking sheet and toss them with a drizzle of olive oil and generous pinches of salt.</li>
            <li>Roast the chickpeas for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Ovens can vary, if your chickpeas are not crispy enough, keep going until they are!</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and, while the chickpeas are still warm, toss with pinches of your favorite spices, if using.</li>
            <li>Store roasted chickpeas in a loosely-covered container at room temperature. They are best used within two days.</li>
        </ol>
